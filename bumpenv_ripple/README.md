# Bumpenv Ripple (currently broken)

Demonstrates the use of DS/DT textures to apply per-pixel pertubation/offset to a diffuse texture. This can be used for distortion effects such as water.

**NOTE:** Currently requires fp20compiler changes that are not yet public. However, I've commented in `shaders/ripple_frag.ps` which combine modes are emitted from the compiler if you want to add them in yourself.
