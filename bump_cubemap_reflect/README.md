# Bump Cubemap Reflection

Demonstrates the use of a normal map, cubemap and reflection vector to create a bumpy reflection effect on objects.

**NOTE:** Currently requires fp20compiler changes that are not yet public. However, I've commented in the register combiner file which combine modes are emitted from the compiler if you want to add them in yourself.
